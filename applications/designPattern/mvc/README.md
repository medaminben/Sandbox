a naive implementation of the [Model View Controller Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller/).
the mvc architure follows a layer structure as in the graph

               View <====> user
                |A
                ||
                V|        
            controller 
                |A
                ||
                V| 
              Model
