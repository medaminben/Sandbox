## Libraries
### Core
The core library defines the common code base such as containers and custom types to ensure a manageable system
The base unit of the system is a value. The system at any moment of the life cycle is not doing other than managing values, but the result of the processing can be errors in exception and corner cases: 
- Value any rValue type
- Error 
- Result<Value,Error>
