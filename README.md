# Sandbox
a practice repo based on [project-unit](https://github.com/medaminben/project-unit) repository


## Libraries
### Core
The core library defines the common code base such as containers and custom types to ensure a manageable system
The base unit of the system is a value. The system at any moment of the life cycle is not doing other than managing values, but the result of the processing can be errors in exception and corner cases: 
- Value any rValue type
- Error 
- Result<Value,Error>  

## Tools
A classic boring tools library
it collects some useful features:
### CSV Parser: 
a tiny csv parser facility highly needed for the deserialization, (no need of serialization right now)
...
## Geo
in one way or another like the standard algorithm library, only collects some geometric manipulation features
